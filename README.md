# My Azure Site, Verson 1.0

### Overview: 
This repository is for my first early iteration of my personal portfolio website. It was my first time creating an Azure static web app, and I used Azure's CI/CD Pipeline to link my site to this Github repository, so any changes I made would be updated in real-time on my Azure site.

I have since deactivated my Azure static web app, but this houses my initial template for my html code that eventually became what's being hosted on adamseverson.com.

### Main takeaway:
This project had a decent learning curve, as I have never used .css stylesheets before, and my HTML programming was still a bit rough. However, setting up the CI/CD pipeline and seeing the site live was very fun and valuable to my future web development knowledge!
