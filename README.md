This repository is for my first early iteration of my personal portfolio website. It was my first time creating an Azure static web app, and I used Azure's CI/CD Pipeline to link my site to this Github repository, so any changes I made would be updated in real-time on my Azure site.
I have since deactivated my Azure static web app, but this houses my initial template for my html code that eventually became what's being hosted on adamseverson.com.
This project had a decent learning curve, and was very fun and valuable to my future web development knowledge!
